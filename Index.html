        <h1 class="fact">The human stomach can dissolve razor blades</h1>
        <p class="fun">If you ever swallow a razor blade, don’t panic.
           The human body is more capable than you think. 
           Acids are ranked on a scale from 0 to 14—the lower the pH level, 
           the stronger the acid. Human stomach acid is typically 1.0 to 2.0, 
           meaning that it has an incredibly strong pH. In a study published in 
           the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, scientists found that the 
           “thickened back of a single-edged blade” dissolved after two hours 
           of immersion in stomach acid. That’s just one of many fun facts about 
           the human body you never learned in school.</p>

        <h1 class="fact">A laser can get trapped in water</h1>
        <p class="fun">A cool thing called “total internal reflection” 
            happens when you point a laser beam at a jet of flowing water. 
            To demonstrate this phenomenon, PBS Learning Media released a 
            video in which a laser is positioned on one side of a clear tank of water. 
            When the light travels through the water, it is slowed by the 
            heavier particles in the water, effectively “trapping” the laser 
            beam in the water. Even as the water flow is gradually decreased, 
            the laser beam remains contained inside the jet, until it eventually 
            disappears when the water is turned off completely. Speaking of lasers, 
            did you know that your iPhone can be hacked with a laser pointer? 
            You do now!

        <h1 class="fact">Earth’s oxygen is produced by the ocean</h1>
        <p class="fun">
            Have you ever stopped to think where oxygen comes from? 
            Your first thought may be a rainforest, but here’s 
            a cool science fact for you: We can thank plant-based 
            marine organisms for all that fresh air, according to 
            the National Oceanic Service. Plankton, seaweed, and 
            other photosynthesizers produce more than half of the world’s oxygen. 
            While we may know the answer to this question, scientists still can’t 
            explain these other ocean mysteries.
